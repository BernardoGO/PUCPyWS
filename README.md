## Name
Aspidites ramsayi, commonly known as Ramsay's python, woma python, and sand python, is a species of snake endemic to Australia. Once common throughout Western Australia, it has become critically endangered in some regions.
Considered to be more active than many pythons, as well as being a very docile and "easy to handle" snake, the woma is highly sought after in the reptile and exotic pet trade. They are one of the hardiest python species in captivity, often readily accepting pre-killed rodents. Although it is considered to be an endangered species, mainly due to the destruction of its natural habitat, this snake will breed in captivity.
